# Installation

## Getting Started with This Template

Before you can document the installation for your own project, you first need to initialize your project from this template:

1.  **Obtain the Template:**
    *   Clone this repository to your local machine.
    *   Alternatively, if this is a GitHub template repository, click the "Use this template" button on GitHub to create your own repository from it.

2.  **Customize the Template:**
    *   Once you have the template files, the very next step is to customize it for your specific project needs. We highly recommend using our [AI-Assisted Setup Guide](./ai_assisted_setup.md) for the quickest and most comprehensive setup.
    *   Alternatively, you can follow the [Manual Setup Guide](./guides/manual_setup.md).

## Documenting Installation for *Your* Project (Built *from* This Template)

This file is a placeholder for your project's specific installation instructions. After you have customized this template (e.g., by running the AI-assisted setup or following the manual setup), you should replace this content with details relevant to installing and running *your* actual application.

## Getting Started with This Template

To use this template as a starting point for your own project:

1.  Obtain a copy of this template (e.g., by using it as a template on GitHub, or by forking/cloning it).
2.  Follow the instructions in either:
    *   [AI-Assisted Setup](./ai_assisted_setup.md) (Recommended)
    *   [Manual Setup](./guides/manual_setup.md)
3.  Once customized, update this `installation.md` file with your project-specific installation steps.
