# Configuration

This file is a placeholder for your project's specific configuration documentation. After you have customized this template (e.g., by running the AI-assisted setup or following the manual setup), you should replace this content with details relevant to your actual application's configuration.

Refer to the main project [README](https://github.com/{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/blob/main/README.md) for overall template guidance.

For instructions on initially customizing the *template itself* (like project name, etc.), please refer to the main [README](https://github.com/{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/blob/main/README.md) or the [AI-Assisted Setup Guide](./ai_assisted_setup.md).
