# Design Philosophy & Key Considerations

This document outlines the core design philosophy behind this FastAPI project template, detailing what aspects are intentionally opinionated to provide a strong starting point, and what aspects are left unopinionated to offer flexibility. It also addresses common questions a senior engineer might have when evaluating this template.

## Template Philosophy: Opinionated vs. Unopinionated

Understanding the choices made in this template can help you leverage it effectively and know where you'll need to make your own architectural decisions.

### This Template IS Opinionated About:

1.  **Web Framework:**
    *   **FastAPI:** The template is explicitly built around FastAPI for the web application layer, leveraging its asynchronous capabilities and Pydantic integration.
2.  **Programming Language & Versioning:**
    *   **Python 3.9+:** The CI pipeline tests against Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11, indicating a strong preference for modern Python versions.
3.  **Environment & Package Management:**
    *   **uv:** The template strongly prefers `uv` for creating virtual environments and managing Python dependencies, highlighting its speed and `pip` compatibility.
4.  **Task Runner:**
    *   **Task:** `Taskfile.yml` is used for defining and running common development tasks (setup, linting, testing, running the app), promoting a consistent command-line interface.
5.  **Linting and Formatting:**
    *   **Ruff:** The template has fully embraced Ruff for high-speed linting (replacing Flake8, isort, Black, etc.) and formatting. `pyproject.toml` contains Ruff's configuration.
    *   **Mypy:** Included for static type checking, configured in `pyproject.toml` and `Taskfile.yml`.
    *   **Bandit & Safety:** Included for security linting and dependency vulnerability scanning.
6.  **Testing Framework:**
    *   **pytest:** The chosen framework for writing and running tests.
    *   **pytest-cov:** Used for generating code coverage reports.
7.  **Containerization (for Local Development):**
    *   **Docker & Docker Compose:** Prescribed for setting up a consistent local development environment and running the application in a containerized manner.
8.  **Build System (for the Core Library):**
    *   **Hatchling:** Used as the build backend for the `your_core_library` package, as defined in `pyproject.toml`.
9.  **CI/CD:**
    *   **GitHub Actions:** The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file defines a CI pipeline specifically for GitHub Actions, including matrix testing for Python versions.
10. **Project Structure:**
    *   **Separation of Concerns:** A distinct `src/your_core_library` for business logic/reusable components and an `app/` directory for the FastAPI web application.
    *   **Configuration Location:** `app/config.py` using Pydantic's `BaseSettings` for application configuration.
11. **Documentation Engine (if enabled):**
    *   **MkDocs with Material Theme:** If documentation deployment is uncommented, it's set up for MkDocs with the Material theme, including Mermaid diagram support.

### This Template Has NO (or very little) Opinion About:

1.  **Specific Database Choice:**
    *   The template itself doesn't integrate or require any particular database (SQL, NoSQL, etc.).
2.  **ORM/Database Interaction Library:**
    *   No ORM (like SQLAlchemy, Tortoise ORM) or specific database driver is included.
3.  **Authentication & Authorization Mechanisms:**
    *   No specific authentication (e.g., OAuth2, JWT, sessions) or authorization patterns are implemented.
4.  **Frontend Framework/Technology:**
    *   The template is backend-focused and includes no frontend framework.
5.  **Asynchronous Task Queues:**
    *   No specific task queue (Celery, ARQ, Dramatiq) is integrated.
6.  **Caching Strategies:**
    *   No caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis integration) are built-in.
7.  **Deployment Environment & Infrastructure:**
    *   It doesn't dictate where or how the application should be deployed (e.g., Kubernetes, Serverless, specific cloud providers).
8.  **Specific Production Web Server Setup (beyond Uvicorn):**
    *   Locally, it uses `uvicorn app.main:app`. Production setups (e.g., Gunicorn + Uvicorn) are not pre-configured.
9.  **Detailed Logging Configuration for Production:**
    *   Provides basic console logging; advanced production logging is left to the implementer.
10. **Specific API Design Patterns (beyond RESTful principles encouraged by FastAPI):**
    *   It doesn't enforce specific advanced API design patterns.
11. **State Management (for the application itself):**
    *   Beyond a basic example on `app.state`, it doesn't prescribe broader application state management.

## Key Considerations & FAQ (Staff Engineer Perspective)

Here are answers to questions a staff engineer might have when evaluating this template:

1.  **Q: Maintainability & Evolution Strategy?**
    *   **A:** The template itself is a "living" repository. Updates (dependencies, base images, Python versions) are managed by regular reviews and tools like `uv pip list --outdated`, potentially augmented by Dependabot on the template repo. For projects spawned from this template, manual porting of updates is one option, but using tools like `copier` or `cruft` for automated merging of template updates is recommended for wider adoption.

2.  **Q: Configuration Management & Environment Parity?**
    *   **A:** The template uses `.env` files (via `.env.example`) loaded by Pydantic's `BaseSettings` for structured local configuration. Docker Compose also uses `.env`. This pattern extends to different environments (staging, prod) by using environment-specific `.env` files or integrating with secret management services, which `BaseSettings` can support. Docker ensures high local environment parity.

3.  **Q: Scalability & Performance?**
    *   **A:** FastAPI and Uvicorn provide a high-performance, scalable foundation. The template is lean and doesn't include elements that inherently hinder scalability for typical API use cases. Users can integrate common scaling solutions (async task queues, specific databases with connection pooling, caching layers) as needed, with the template offering flexibility rather than imposing choices.

4.  **Q: Security Posture & Extensibility?**
    *   **A:** Baseline security includes static analysis via Ruff (incorporating `flake8-bandit`) and `safety` for dependency scanning, enforced in CI. Docker images are official Python ones (users should consider non-root users for production). The template is unopinionated on AuthN/AuthZ, allowing teams to integrate standard FastAPI security mechanisms. Pydantic models provide data validation. Production secrets management should be handled via dedicated services.

5.  **Q: Developer Experience & Onboarding?**
    *   **A:** Developers familiar with modern Python tools should be productive quickly. `Taskfile.yml` standardizes common commands. `README.md` guides placeholder replacement. The local environment (Docker, `uv`, Task) aims for consistency and ease of setup. The chosen tools (FastAPI, Pydantic, Ruff, `uv`, Task, Docker) are well-documented and generally have a reasonable learning curve.
